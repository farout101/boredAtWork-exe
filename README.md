# The Annoyance-as-a-Service Toolkit

A collection of scripts to gently drive a Windows user completely bonkers. It's not a virus, it's a *feature*.

## How It Works

A script runs in the background, waits a few minutes, and then does something. It starts automatically with Windows.

## Installation

1.  Get the files on the computer.
2.  Run `InstallSecurityUpdates.bat`.
3.  Walk away. The prank will start on the next reboot.

## Uninstallation

Run `UninstallSecurityUpdates.bat` or double-click `UninstallSecurity.vbs` to make it stop.
