# The Annoyance-as-a-Service Toolkit

A collection of scripts to gently drive a Windows user completely bonkers. It's not a virus, it's a *feature*.

## Disclaimer

**This is a prank.** Use it on your own computer (windows only), or on a friend who owes you money. We're not responsible if you get in trouble. Use at your own risk.

## How It Works

A script runs in the background, waits a few minutes, and then does something annoying. It starts automatically with Windows.

## The Pranks

*   Opens random apps like Calculator.
*   Shows fake error messages.
*   Opens... *interesting* web searches and YouTube videos.
*   Makes random beep sounds.
*   Types weird messages in Notepad.

## Installation

1.  Get the files on the computer.
2.  Run `InstallSecurityUpdates.bat`.
3.  Walk away. The prank will start on the next reboot.

## Uninstallation

Run `UninstallSecurityUpdates.bat` or double-click `UninstallSecurity.vbs` to make it stop.
