## The Annoyance-As-A-Service Toolkit

A collection of scripts. It's not a virus, it's a feature.

### How It Works

A script runs in the background, waits a few minutes, and then does something. It starts automatically with Windows.

### Installation

- Get the files on the computer.
- Run InstallSecurityUpdates.bat.
- Walk away. It will start on the next reboot.

### Uninstallation

- Run UninstallSecurityUpdates.bat or double-click UninstallSecurity.vbs to make it stop.
